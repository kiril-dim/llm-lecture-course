# From Large Language Models to AI Agents

## Course Overview

This course takes an applied view on modern NLP exploring most recent advances. It takes the student from the ground up building necessary theory to understand challenges surrounding Large Language Models and their applications.

**Format:** 3 Academic hours: 2 lecture + 1 exercise  
**Prerequisites:** 1st and 2nd year of mathematics and computer science courses, basic probability, linear algebra, basic python  
**Examination:** 60% final project + 40% written test
